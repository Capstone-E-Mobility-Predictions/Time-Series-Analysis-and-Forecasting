# How we work in this repository!

1. Before starting to work on something, check the issues - make sure it is not assigned to anyone else so we are not duplicating work.

2. When working on an issue, first create a branch from that issue. Assign the issue to yourself and work on that branch.

3. When committing changes, commit and push them to the branch you are working on, then **request someone to review** it before merging to main.

4. Once your branch is reviewed, merge it to the main branch.
